  * How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

2. Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

3. Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

4. Write code to partition a list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.

5. Write code to sum up two lists

6. Check if linked list is a palindrome

7. Given two linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect (by reference)

8. Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns the node at the beginning of the loop.
